## 🙏 Acknowledgments

This project, **The Wild Oasis**, was inspired and guided by the Udemy course  
**[The Ultimate React & Next.js Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course/)** by Jonas Schmedtmann.

Special thanks to Jonas for his outstanding teaching, real-world project structure, and deep explanations of:

- **Modern React & Design Patterns**
- **Scalable component architecture**
- **Data fetching with React Query**
- **Authentication workflows**
- **Dashboard design & UI best practices**

This course played a major role in shaping the development of **The Wild Oasis**, where I learned and applied these concepts to build a real-world hotel management system project.
